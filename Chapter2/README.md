# Functionalism_Contrast_Change - Chapter 2
  
The main files presented in this folder are:


1. **wordlist.txt**: this is the 150-word English wordlist that I used for my dissertation. The word was manually compiled using the [5000 most frequent lemmas in COCA](https://www.wordfrequency.info/freeList.asp) and filtering the words which could fit a CVC frame. The symbol ```-``` is used to separate each phoneme (with some idealization, cf. p.21 of my dissertation document). 

2. **sound_change.py**: this Python3 script contains the core of the code used for the sound change simulations. The syntax is ```python3 sound_change.py file n_changes n_simulations```. A Jupyter Notebook version is under construction.


The other folders contain variations of the wordlist and of the script that have been used to perform the analysis in Chapter 2.
